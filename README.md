# Djikstra's "Shortest Path" Algorithm by Kabir Bose, Matthew Allicock, Zuhaib Shafi, Khono Tshwete

# Purpose

This project utilizes Djikstra's "Shortest Path" algorithm and graph theory to help users find the most efficient route to an EV charger from their current location. The route map is modelled using a graph data structure consisting of nodes A to W, along with their respective weighted edges. Some of these nodes represent EV charging stations.

# Setup

1. Using your terminal, open the directory consisting of `route-optimization.py`
2. Run the program using `python3 route-optimzation.py`
3. Enter a source node/destination to find the shortest path from your chosen node to each EV charger
