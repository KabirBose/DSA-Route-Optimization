# Djikstra's "Shortest Path" Algorithm

### Implemented by Kabir Bose, Matthew Allicock, Zuhaib Shafi, Khono Tshwete

# Purpose

This project uses Djikstra's "Shortest Path" algorithm to help users find the most efficient route to an EV charger from there current location. This route map is modelled using a graph data structure consisting of nodes A to W, along with their respective weighted edges.

# Setup

1. Open the directory holding `route-optimization.py`
2. Open the file `route-optimization.py`
3. Run the program using `python3 route-optimzation.py`
4. Enter a source node/destination
5. Complete
