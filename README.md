# Djikstra's "Shortest Path" Algorithm

## _implemented by Kabir Bose, Matthew Allicock, Zuhaib Shafi_

# Purpose

This project uses Djikstra's "Shortest Path" algorithm to help users find the most efficient route to an EV charger from there current location. This route map is modelled using a graph data structure consisting of nodes A to W, along with their respective weighted edges.
