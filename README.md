# Route Optimization

A project that I completed in my Data Structures & Algorithms class that applies my knowledge of graph theory and Djikstra's **Shortest Path** Algorithm. 

# Setup

1. Open your terminal and `cd` into the directory of the file
2. Enter `python3 route-optimization.py`

# Usage

After the program is running, you can simply follow the prompts that the program requires to test it out.
