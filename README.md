# Djikstra's "Shortest Path" Algorithm

### Implemented by Kabir Bose, Matthew Allicock, Zuhaib Shafi

# Purpose

This project uses Djikstra's "Shortest Path" algorithm to help users find the most efficient route to an EV charger from there current location. This route map is modelled using a graph data structure consisting of nodes A to W, along with their respective weighted edges.

# Setup

1. Open the directory holding `route-optimization.py`
2. Go to the file `route-optimization.py`
3. Scroll down to lines 96 to 99
4. Un-comment the function you want to use based on which EV charger you need (you cannot run multiple functions at the same time for performance reasons)
5. On line 91, you can also change your source/starting node if required
6. Once changes are made, run the program using `python3 route-optimzation.py`
